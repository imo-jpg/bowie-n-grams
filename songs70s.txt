The tactful cactus by your window Surveys the prairie of your room The mobile spins to its collision Clara puts her head between her paws They've opened shops down West side Will all the cacti find a home But the key to the city Is in the sun that pins the branches to the sky
And so the story goes they wore the clothes They said the things to make it seem improbable The whale of a lie like they hope it was And the Goodmen Tomorrow Had their feet in the wallow And their heads of Brawn were nicer shorn And how they bought their positions with saccharin and trust And the world was asleep to our latent fuss Sighing, the swirl through the streets Like the crust of the sun The Bewlay Brothers In our Wings that Bark Flashing teeth of Brass Standing tall in the dark Oh, And we were Gone Hanging out with your Dwarf Men We were so turned on By your lack of conclusions I was Stone and he was Wax So he could scream, and still relax, unbelievable And we frightened the small children away And our talk was old and dust would flow Through our veins and Lo! it was midnight Back at the kitchen door Like the grim face on the Cathedral floor And the solid book we wrote Cannot be found today And it was Stalking time for the Moonboys The Bewlay Brothers With our backs on the arch In the Devil-may-be-here But He can't sing about that Oh, And we were Gone Real Cool Traders We were so Turned On You thought we were Fakers Now the dress is hung, the ticket pawned The Factor Max that proved the fact Is melted down And woven on the edging of my pillow Now my Brother lays upon the Rocks He could be dead, He could be not He could be You He's Chameleon, Comedian, Corinthian and Caricature Shooting-up Pie-in-the-Sky The Bewlay Brothers In the feeble and the Bad Bewlay Brothers In the Blessed and Cold In the Crutch-hungry Dark Was where we flayed our Mark Oh, and we were Gone Kings of Oblivion We were so Turned On In the Mind-Warp Pavilion Lay me place and bake me Pie I'm starving for me Gravy Leave my shoes, and door unlocked I might just slip away, hey Just for the Day, Hey! Hey, Please come Away, Hey! Just for the Day, Hey! Please come Away, Hey! Please come Away, Hey! Just for the Day Please come Away Please come Away Please come Away Please come Away Away (Away) Away Hey
It's a God-awful small affair To the girl with the mousy hair But her mummy is yelling "No!" And her daddy has told her to go But her friend is nowhere to be seen Now she walks through her sunken dream To the seat with the clearest view And she's hooked to the silver screen But the film is a sadd'ning bore For she's lived it ten times or more She could spit in the eyes of fools As they ask her to focus on Sailors fighting in the dancehall Oh, man! Look at those cavemen go It's the freakiest show Take a look at the Lawman beating up the wrong guy Oh, man! Wonder if he'll ever know Who's in the best-selling show Is there life on Mars? It's on America's tortured brow That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow Now the workers have struck for fame 'Cause Lennon's on sale again See the mice in their million hordes From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads Rule Britannia is out of bounds To my mother, my dog, and clowns But the film is a sadd'ning bore 'Cause I wrote it ten times or more It's about to be writ again As I ask you to focus on Sailors fighting in the dancehall Oh, man! Look at those cavemen go It's the freakiest show Take a look at the Lawman beating up the wrong guy Oh, man! Wonder if he'll ever know Who's in the best-selling show Is there life on Mars?
Oh, hear this, Robert Zimmerman I wrote a song for you About a strange young man called Dylan With a voice like sand and glue His words of truthful vengeance They could pin us to the floor Brought a few more people on And put the fear in a whole lot more Ah, here she comes Here she comes Here she comes again The same old painted lady From the brow of a superbrain She'll scratch this world to pieces As she comes on like a friend But a couple of songs From your old scrapbook Could send her home again You gave your heart to every bedsit room At least a picture on the wall And you sat behind a million pair of eyes And told them how they saw Then we lost your train of thought The paintings are all your own While troubles are rising We'd rather be scared Together than alone Ah, here she comes Here she comes Here she comes again The same old painted lady From the brow of a superbrain She'll scratch this world to pieces As she comes on like a friend But a couple of songs From your old scrapbook Could send her home again Now hear this, Robert Zimmerman Though I don't suppose we'll meet Ask your good friend Dylan If he'd gaze a while down the old street Tell him we've lost his poems So we're writing on the walls Give us back our unity Give us back our family You're every nation's refugee Don't leave us with their sanity Ah, here she comes Here she comes Here she comes again The same old painted lady From the brow of a superbrain She'll scratch this world to pieces As she comes on like a friend But a couple of songs From your old scrapbook Could send her home again Ah, a couple of songs From your old scrapbook Could send her home again Oh, here she comes Here she comes Here she comes
I'm closer to the Golden Dawn Immersed in Crowley's uniform of imagery I'm living in a silent film Portraying Himmler's sacred realm of dream reality I'm frightened by the total goal Drawing to the ragged hole And I ain't got the power anymore No I ain't got the power anymore I'm the twisted name on Garbo's eyes Living proof of Churchill's lies; I'm destiny I'm torn between the light and dark Where others see their targets in divine symmetry Should I kiss the viper's fang Or herald loud the death of Man I'm sinking in the quicksand of my thought And I ain't got the power anymore Don't believe in yourself Don't deceive with belief Knowledge comes with death's release Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah I'm not a prophet or a stone age man Just a mortal with potential of a superman; I'm living on I'm tethered to the logic of homo sapiens Can't take my eyes from the great salvation of bullshit faith If I don't explain what you ought to know You can tell me all about it on the next Bardo I'm sinking in the quicksand of my thought And I ain't got the power anymore Don't believe in yourself Don't deceive with belief Knowledge comes with death's release Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah Don't believe in yourself Don't deceive with belief Knowledge comes with death's release Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah a
