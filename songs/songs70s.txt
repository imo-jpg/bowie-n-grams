In the corner of the morning in the past I would sit and blame the master first and last All the roads were straight and narrow And the prayers were small and yellow And the rumour spread that I was aging fast Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping by a tree And I looked and frowned and the monster was me Well, I said hello and I said hello And I asked "Why not?" and I replied "I don't know." So we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be And he laughed insane and quipped "KAHLIL GIBRAN" So I cried for all the others till the day was nearly through For I realized that God's a young man too So I said "So long" and I waved "Bye-bye" And I smashed my soul and traded my mind Got laid by a young bordello Who was vaguely half asleep For which my reputation swept back home in drag And the moral of this magic spell Negotiates my hide When God did take my logic for a ride (Riding along) He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips And showed me the leather belt round his hips My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame He said "You'll never go down to the Gods again" (Turn around, go back!) He struck the ground a cavern appeared And I smelt the burning pit of fear We crashed a thousand yards below I said "Do it again, do it again" (Turn around, go back!) His nebulous body swayed above His tongue swollen with devil's love The snake and I, a venom high I said "Do it again, do it again" (Turn around, go back!) Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply And I was seething, breathing deeply Spitting sentry, horned and tailed Waiting for you Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Day after day They send my friends away To mansions cold and grey To the far side of town Where the thin men stalk the streets While the sane stay underground Day after day They tell me I can go They tell me I can blow To the far side of town Where it's pointless to be high 'Cause it's such a long way down So I tell them that I can fly, I will scream I will break my arm I will do me harm Here I stand Foot in hand Talking to my wall I'm not quite right at all Am I? Don't set me free I'm as heavy as can be Just my librium and me And my E.S.T. makes three 'Cause I'd rather stay here With all the madmen Than perish with the sad men roaming free And I'd rather play here With all the madmen For I'm quite content they're all as sane as me (Where can the horizon lie When a nation hides Its organic minds In a cellar Dark and grim They must be very dim) Day after day They take some brain away Then turn my face around To the far side of town And tell me that it's real Then ask me how I feel Here I stand Foot in hand Talking to my wall I'm not quite right at all Don't set me free I'm as helpless as can be My libido's split on me Gimme some good 'ole lobotomy 'Cause I'd rather stay here With all the madmen Than perish with the sad men Roaming free And I'd rather play here With all the madmen For I'm quite content They're all as sane as me Zane, Zane, Zane Ouvre le Chien

When all the world was very young And mountain magic heavy hung The supermen would walk in file Guardians of a loveless isle And gloomy browed with superfear Their endless tragic lives Could heave nor sigh In solemn, perverse serenity Wondrous beings chained to life Strange games they would play then No death for the perfect men Life rolls into one for them So softly a supergod cries Where all were minds in uni-thought Power weird by mystics taught No pain, no joy, no power too great Colossal strength to grasp a fate Where sad-eyed mermen tossed in slumbers Nightmare dreams no mortal mind could hold A man would tear his brother's flesh A chance to die To turn to mold Far out in the red-sky Far out from the sad eyes Strange, mad celebration So softly a supergod cries Far out in the red-sky Far out from the sad eyes Strange, mad celebration So softly a supergod dies

Shakey threw a party that lasted all night Everybody drank a lot of something nice There was an old-fashioned band of married men Looking up to me for encouragement - it was so-so The ladies looked bad but the music was sad No one took their eyes off Lorraine She shimmered and she strolled like a Chicago moll Her feathers looked better and better - it was so-so Yeah! It was time to unfreeze When the Reverend Alabaster danced on his knees Slam! So it wasn't a game Cracking all the mirrors in shame Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man! He walks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man! He walks like a jerk but he's only taking care of the room Must be in tune A Benny Goodman fan painted holes in his hands Shakey hung him up to dry The pundits were joking, the manholes were smoking Every bottle battled with the reason why The girl on the phone wouldn't leave me alone A throw back from someone's LP A lemon in a bag played a Tiger Rag And the villains on the screen stopped bleeding Yeah! I was shaking like a leaf For I couldn't understand the conversation Yeah! And I ran to the street, looking for information Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man! He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man!

She'll come, she'll go. She'll lay belief on you Skin sweet with musky oil The lady from another grinning soul Cologne she'll wear. Silver and Americard She'll drive a beetle car And beat you down at cool Canasta And when the clothes are strewn Don't be afraid of the room Touch the fullness of her breast. Feel the love of her caress She will be your living end She'll come, she'll go. She'll lay belief on you But she won't stake her life on you How can life become Her point of view And when the clothes are strewn Don't be afraid of the room Touch the fullness of her breast. Feel the love of her caress She will be your living end (repeat)
