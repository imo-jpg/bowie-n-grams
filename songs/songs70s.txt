In the corner of the morning in the past I would sit and blame the master first and last All the roads were straight and narrow And the prayers were small and yellow And the rumour spread that I was aging fast Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping by a tree And I looked and frowned and the monster was me Well, I said hello and I said hello And I asked "Why not?" and I replied "I don't know." So we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be And he laughed insane and quipped "KAHLIL GIBRAN" So I cried for all the others till the day was nearly through For I realized that God's a young man too So I said "So long" and I waved "Bye-bye" And I smashed my soul and traded my mind Got laid by a young bordello Who was vaguely half asleep For which my reputation swept back home in drag And the moral of this magic spell Negotiates my hide When God did take my logic for a ride (Riding along) He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips And showed me the leather belt round his hips My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame He said "You'll never go down to the Gods again" (Turn around, go back!) He struck the ground a cavern appeared And I smelt the burning pit of fear We crashed a thousand yards below I said "Do it again, do it again" (Turn around, go back!) His nebulous body swayed above His tongue swollen with devil's love The snake and I, a venom high I said "Do it again, do it again" (Turn around, go back!) Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply And I was seething, breathing deeply Spitting sentry, horned and tailed Waiting for you Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

When all the world was very young And mountain magic heavy hung The supermen would walk in file Guardians of a loveless isle And gloomy browed with superfear Their endless tragic lives Could heave nor sigh In solemn, perverse serenity Wondrous beings chained to life Strange games they would play then No death for the perfect men Life rolls into one for them So softly a supergod cries Where all were minds in uni-thought Power weird by mystics taught No pain, no joy, no power too great Colossal strength to grasp a fate Where sad-eyed mermen tossed in slumbers Nightmare dreams no mortal mind could hold A man would tear his brother's flesh A chance to die To turn to mold Far out in the red-sky Far out from the sad eyes Strange, mad celebration So softly a supergod cries Far out in the red-sky Far out from the sad eyes Strange, mad celebration So softly a supergod dies

And in the death, As the last few corpses lay rotting on the slimy thoroughfare, The shutters lifted in inches in Temperance Building High on Poacher's Hill And red mutant eyes gaze down on Hunger City No more big wheels. Fleas the size of rats sucked on rats the size of cats And ten thousand peoploids split into small tribes Coveting the highest of the sterile skyscrapers Like packs of dogs assaulting the glass fronts of Love-Me Avenue Ripping and rewrapping mink and shiny silver fox -now legwarmers Family badge of sapphire and cracked emerald Any day now The Year of the Diamond Dogs This ain't rock'n'roll - this is genocide.
As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent You asked for the latest party With your silicon hump and your ten-inch stump Dressed like a priest you was, Todd Browning's freak you was. Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee I'm sure you're not protected for it's plain to see The Diamond Dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees Hunt you to the ground they will, Mannequins with kill appeal Will they come? - I keep a friend serene Will they come? - Oh, baby, come unto me Will they come? - Well, she's come, been, and gone Come out of the garden, baby You'll catch your death in the fog Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase The elevator's broke, so he slides down a rope Onto the street below Oh Tarzie, go man go Meets his little hussy with his ghost town approach Her face is sans feature but she wears a Dali brooch Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake Wrecked up and paralysed Diamond Dogs are civilised Will they come? - I keep a friend serene Will they come? - Oh, baby, come unto me Will they come? - Well, she's come, been, and gone Come out of the garden, baby You'll catch your death in the fog Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs Woo-ooh-hoo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs Oh!

It's safe in the city to love in a doorway To wrangle some screams from the dawn And isn't it me, putting pain in a stranger? Like a portrait in flesh, who trails on a leash Will you see that I'm scared and I'm lonely? So I'll break up my room, and yawn and I Run to the center of things Where the knowing one says Boys, boys, it's a sweet thing Boys, boys, it's a sweet thing, sweet thing If you want it, boys, get it here, thing 'Cause hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing I'm glad that you're older than me Makes me feel important and free Does that make you smile, isn't that me? I'm in your way, and I'll steal every moment If this trade is a curse, then I'll bless you And turn to the crossroads, and hamburgers, and... Boys, boys, it's a sweet thing Boys, boys, it's a sweet thing, sweet thing If you want it, boys, get it here, thing 'Cause hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing
If you want it, boys, get it here thing 'Cause hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing Is it nice in your snow storm, freezing your brain? Do you think that your face looks the same? Then let it be, it's all I ever wanted It's a street with a deal, and a taste It's got claws, it's got me, it's got you
I'll make you a deal like any other candidate. We'll pretend were walking home cause your future's at stake My set is amazing, it even smells like the street There is a bar at the end where I could meet you and your friend. Someone scrawled on the wall "I smell the blood of les tricoteuses" Who wrote up scandals in other bars I am having so much fun with the poisonous people Spreading rumors and lies and stories they made up Some make you sing and some make you scream One makes you wish that you never been seen But there's a shop on the corner selling papier mache Making bullet-proof faces Charles Manson, Cassius Clay If you want it, boys get it here thing. So you scream out of line "I want you! I need you! Anyone out there? Anytime? Tres butch little numberwang "Hey girlie, I want you When it's good it's really good and when it's bad I go to pieces" If you want it, boys, get it here, thing Well, on the street where you live I could not hold up my head For I put all I have in another bed On another floor, in the back of a car In the cellar of a church with the door ajar. Well, I guess we must be looking for a different kind But we can't stop trying till we break up our minds Till the sun drips blood on the seedy young knights Who press you on the ground while shaking in fright I guess we could cruise down one more time With you by my side, it should be fine We'll buy some drugs and watch a band Then jump in the river holding hand

You always were the one that knew They sold us for the likes of you I always wanted new surroundings A room to rent while the lizards lay crying in the heat Trying to remember who to meet I would take a foxy kind of stand While tens of thousands found me in demand When you rock 'n' roll with me No one else I'd rather be Nobody here can do it for me I'm in tears again When you rock 'n' roll with me Gentle hearts are counted down The queue is out of sight and out of sounds Me, I'm out of breath, but not quite doubting I've found a door which lets me out! When you rock 'n' roll with me No one else I'd rather be Nobody down here can do it for me I'm in tears again When you rock 'n' roll with me Oh, when you rock 'n' roll with me, There's no one else I'd rather be, oh Nobody down here can do it for me When you rock 'n' roll with me When you rock 'n' roll, rock 'n' roll with me No one else I'd rather, I'd rather be Nobody down here can do it for me I'm in tears, I'm in tears When you rock 'n' roll with me
